Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis
Project Overview

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews to classify customer feedback as positive, negative, or neutral. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from textual data and demonstrate end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

The project covers data preprocessing, text vectorization, model training, evaluation, and result interpretation.

Business Problem

Customer reviews contain valuable insights about product quality and user satisfaction. However, analyzing large volumes of unstructured text manually is not feasible.
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can automatically determine customer sentiment, helping businesses:

Understand customer opinions at scale

Improve products and services

Support data-driven decision making
