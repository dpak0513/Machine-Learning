# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of end-to-end machine learning projects demonstrating core ML concepts, model building, evaluation, and optimization using real-world datasets.

## Overview
The projects focus on solving supervised and unsupervised learning problems with an emphasis on:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
- Model evaluation using industry-standard metrics

## Key Concepts Covered
- Regression and Classification algorithms
- Handling class imbalance
- Bias–variance tradeoff
- Model generalization and robustness

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Example Projects
- Customer Churn Prediction using Random Forest
- Amazon Product Review Sentiment Analysis using NLP techniques
- Intent Classification using BERT and Logistic Regression  

## Outcomes
- Built and evaluated ML models with strong generalization on unseen data
- Achieved ROC-AUC scores of approximately 0.78 on imbalanced classification problems
- Applied hyperparameter tuning techniques to improve model performance


## What This Demonstrates
