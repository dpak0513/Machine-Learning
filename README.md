Machine Learning Repository

This repository contains a collection of end-to-end Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing projects developed to solve real-world business and analytics problems.
The projects demonstrate practical experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation, using both classical machine learning and modern NLP techniques.

Repository Overview

The repository includes three major Machine Learning projects:

Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
A supervised learning project focused on predicting customer churn using tree-based models and hyperparameter tuning.

Intent Classification System
A text classification project that compares traditional machine learning approaches with transformer-based deep learning models for intent detection.

Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis
A Natural Language Processing project that analyzes customer reviews to determine sentiment and extract actionable insights.
